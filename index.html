    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, unified fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical roof. Its core principle — form follows function — dictated that every visual decision serve a practical purpose. Faculty including Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee developed the Vorkurs curriculum emphasizing geometric abstraction, primary colors, and modular composition. Typography, furniture, and architecture all followed these rational principles. When the Nazis closed the school in 1933, its teachers and students dispersed internationally, spreading modernist design ideas to Europe and the United States. Bauhaus set the foundation for contemporary graphic and product design education worldwide.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Swiss Style, also known as International Typographic Style, emerged in Switzerland during the 1950s and 1960s. Designers like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann formalized the grid system to achieve clarity, objectivity, and visual harmony. Typography emphasized sans-serif typefaces, precise alignment, and clear hierarchy, while photography was used objectively to communicate factual information. Asymmetrical layouts balanced text and image without relying on symmetry. The movement influenced corporate identity, print, and signage worldwide, establishing a universal visual language. Swiss Style remains a foundation for modern graphic design education, exemplifying rationality, neutrality, and rigorous typographic standards.</p>

        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus, because while both emphasize simplicity, Swiss Style focuses more on typographic grids and objective photography.

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1970s-1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>New Wave Typography, pioneered by Wolfgang Weingart in Switzerland, deliberately broke the rigid Swiss grid system to create expressive, experimental layouts. Designers used grid disruption, diagonal composition, layering, and typographic experimentation to inject dynamism and emotion into printed materials. While Swiss Style prioritized clarity and neutrality, New Wave emphasized visual tension, rhythm, and playful interaction between text and image. The movement influenced graphic design worldwide, inspiring poster art, advertising, and editorial layouts. Despite its experimental appearance, each design choice was purposeful, extending the logic of Swiss rationalism into a postmodern context, challenging conventions while maintaining visual cohesion.</p>
