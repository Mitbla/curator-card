## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. Bauhaus was founded in Germany by Walter Gropius.
2. Swiss Style uses grids and Helvetica for clean layouts.
3. New Wave Typography breaks Swiss grids with expressive layouts.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Exact dates for Swiss Style emergence
2. How New Wave designers intentionally broke the grid.
3. Example museum collections for New Wave Posters.

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1. Vorkurs
2. Modular grid
3. Grid disruption

Design Movements Timeline:
Bauhaus (1919–1933) --> Modernist foundation --> Influenced Swiss Style
Swiss Style (1950s–1970s) --> Grid, Helvetica, objectivity --> Influenced New Wave
New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s) --> Expressive, grid disruption, layering


## PINNED: VOCABULARY

```
Source: AI-generated via Prompt Pack > Controlled Vocabulary prompt.
Keep only the terms you will actually use. Kill the rest.
```

Bauhaus: Vorkurs · geometric abstraction · form follows function · modular grid · sans-serif typography
Swiss Style: grid system · asymmetrical layout · typographic hierarchy · Akzidenz-Grotesk · objective photography
New Wave: grid disruption · typographic experimentation · layering · diagonal composition · postmodern typography


## PINNED: CONFUSIONS AND BOUNDARIES

```
Source: AI-generated via Prompt Pack > Confusions prompt.
Pin the distinctions that surprised you or corrected you.
```

1. Bauhaus is not Swiss Style — Bauhaus is more interdisciplinary.
2. New Wave is not random — it references Swiss grids but breaks rules purposefully.
3. Swiss Style is not New Wave — it is rigid, objective, and structured.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | New Wave Typography — it reacts to Swiss grids with expressive layouts |
| Expert for critique | Wolfgang Weingart — pioneer of New Wave typography and grid experimentation |


## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1. I thought New Wave was completely random, but it’s purposeful experimentation.
2. I underestimated how Swiss Style influenced New Wave designers.
