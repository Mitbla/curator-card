## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

The AI initially implied that New Wave typography was random and unstructured. I suspected this was incorrect because I knew it referenced Swiss grids. I confirmed via Museum für Gestaltung Zürich exhibition materials that New Wave is purposeful experimentation built on Swiss principles.
